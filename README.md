# ðŸ§… OnionC2Implant â€“ Modular Tor-based C2 Infrastructure

**OnionC2Implant** is a modular Command & Control (C2) infrastructure designed for research, red teaming, and ethical malware development.  
It consists of three main components:

1. **C++ Agent** â€“ Lightweight implant communicating over HTTP(S)
2. **Redirector** â€“ Programmable Python-based redirector using FastAPI
3. **C2 Server** â€“ PHP backend hosted on a `.onion` hidden service via Tor
